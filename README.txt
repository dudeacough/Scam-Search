Rental Scam Search


Have you ever been renting out a place and get contacted by someone who saw "your" listing on a site you didn't
post at asking if you would honor the cheaper advertisement they saw.  Usually this is followed by a reply notifying
them the listing was a scam.

The intent of this program is to input a URL listing of a rental property from Zillow, copy the pictures and zip code.
Then perform a search on craiglist for rentals in the same zip code.  Then open up each of the search results on
craiglist and compare the images to the zillow URL.

The program will return a file containing the URLs of the craiglist sites that contain photos that are simliar to the
photos copied from the provided Zillow URL.

This project is intended for personal growth in coding with Python.
